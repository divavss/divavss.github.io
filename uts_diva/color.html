			<h4>In typography, color is a term with two meanings.First, typographers will <br>
				sometimes speak of a font as creating a certain color on the page—even <br>
				when it’s black.Used this way, the word encapsulates a set of hard-<br>
				to-quantify characteristics like darkness, contrast, rhythm, and texture.<br>
				The second meaning is the usual one—color as the opposite of black <br>
				& white.This was once an irrelevant topic, as most of us had to be <br>
				satisfied with monochrome laser printers. These days, color printers<br>
				are ubiquitous and more writing is delivered on screen. So color has<br>
				become a practical consideration.</h4>
			<br>
			<h4> 1.On a page of text, nothing draws the eye more powerfully than a contrast<br>
			between light and dark colors. This is why a bold font creates more emphasis
			than an italic font. (See also bold or italic.)</h4>
			<br>
			<h4>2.The perceived intensity of colored type depends not just on the color, but <br>
				also the size and weight of the font. So a thin or small font can carry a more <br>intense color than a heavy or large font.</h4>
			<br>
			<h4>3.I’m not saying it can never be done well, but when someone puts colored type on a
				colored background, I usually wish they hadn’t.<br>
				<br>



			<h2>In print</h2>
			<h4>body text in printed documents (e.g., résumés, research papers, letters) must<br>
				always be set in black type. No exceptions.<br><br>

				At a typical body-text point size, color isn’t effective as a form of emphasis.
				Small letterforms don’t cover much surface area on the page, so colored text
				isn’t noticed unless it’s loud.<br><br>


			<h4>Professionally printed documents (e.g., letterhead, business cards) can <br>
				include text set in color, but use it judiciously. Multiple shades of <br>
				 one color are usually better than multiple contrasting colors.<br>
				<br>
			<h2>on website</h2>
			<h4>Consider making your text dark gray rather than black. Unlike a piece of <br>
				paper—which reflects ambient light—a computer screen projects its own light <br>
				and tends to have more severe contrast. Therefore, on screen, dark-gray text <br>
				can be more comfortable to read than black text. That’s why many digital-book <br> readers let you reduce the screen brightness or change the text color.<br>
				<br>

			<h2>In PDFS</h2>
			<h4>PDFs are read on both screen and paper, so which set of rules you follow depends <br>
			 on how you expect the PDF to be used. If there’s a reasonable chance the PDF will
			 be printed, don’t bother with dark-gray body text—it’ll look gritty and strange<br>
			 when printed.
			 <br>

			 <h4> recommend color for bates numbering because it’s meant to stand <br>out on the page.</h4>
			<h4>Color in presentations is covered in that section.</h4>
